## About

Seeing how the UI would look and interact with it without having to spin up a starter template and a stable internet connection is really helpful, even when I'm travelling, I can create UIs and see how it would actually _feel_ when the app is finally built. This also meant creating mocks and MVPs offline became viable. It's like a playground for shopify apps.
